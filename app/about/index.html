        <h1>About Squid Notes</h1>
        <p>Squid Notes originally started because our team thought carrying books around was a hassle. Textbooks are big and heavy, and you have to switch them for each class. Losing a book or notebook means losing all the data that you’ve organized on them.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose and dream of Squid Notes is to lighten the bags of students around the world by replacing thick and heavy paper texts with light, digital textbooks.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Digital textbooks with interactive features.</li>
            <li>Seamless integration for online and offline use.</li>
            <li>Collaborative tools to help students work together.</li>
        </ul>
