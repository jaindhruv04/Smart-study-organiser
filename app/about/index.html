        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>
                Squid Notes originally started because our team thought carrying books around was a hassle. Textbooks are big and heavy, and you have to switch them for each class. Losing a book or a notebook means losing all the data that youâ€™ve organized on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose and dream of Squid Notes is to lighten the bags of students around the world by replacing thick and heavy paper texts with light, digital textbooks. Technology has improved tremendously, but the way of studying has not caught up. With Squid Notes, studying becomes enjoyable and easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to innovate the studying environment and experience by providing the best digital study tool.
